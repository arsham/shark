# NeoVim setup, fast as a shark

The goal of this project is to have a fast Neovim startup, provide mappings
that can be easily memorised, interact with the **Lua** API, and make
programming fun.

This project supports Neovim version `0.10.0` and newer.

## Highlights

- Besides in a few places that Neovim doesn't provide an API in Lua, most
  configuration is done in **Lua**.
- You can add the current location of the cursor or make **notes** on the
  current location in the **quickfix/local** lists with repeatable mappings.
- You can **manipulate** quickfix/local lists.

## Setup

Just clone this project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/arsham/shark.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Once you start `Neovim`, it will install the package manager and installs the
listed plugins.

## Functionality

### Plugins

This list might change at any time depending on if there is a better
replacement or the requirement changes.

Some plugins are not listed here. You can find the complete list in the
[plugins](./lua/plugins/) folder.

Licenses for plugins can be found [here](#plugin-license-list).

### Core Mappings

In most mappings we are following this theme, unless there is an uncomfortable
situation or messes with a community-driven or Vim's very well known mapping:

| Part of mapping | Description                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **q**           | **Q**uickfix list mappings                        |
| **w**           | **L**ocal list mappings (because it's near **q**) |
| **]**           | Jumps to the next item                            |
| **[**           | Jumps to the previous item                        |

The `leader` key is `space`!

### Lists

There are a few tools for interacting with **quickfix** and **local** lists.
Following mappings can be used for either cases, all you need to do it to
substitute `w` for `q` or vice versa. Generally **q** is for **quickfix** list
and **w** is for **local list**. I chose **w** because it's beside **q** and it
makes it easy to think about these two types of lists.

`<leader>qq`, `<leader>ww`, `<leader>qn` and `<leader>wn` are repeatable with
**.**!

After adding an item to the list, an indicator in the **statusline** will show
you how many items you have in a list.

| Command         | Description                                 |

### Utilities

These are commands you can use in **Lua** land. Assign the required module to a
variable and re-use.

```lua
local quick = require("arshlib.quick")
```

#### Normal

Executes a normal command. For example:

```lua
quick.normal("n", "y2k")
```

See `:h feedkeys()` for values of the mode.

#### Highlight

Create `highlight` groups:

```lua
quick.highlight("LspReferenceRead", { ctermbg = 180, guibg = "#43464F", style = "bold" })
```

#### Call and Centre

These functions will call your function/command and then centres the buffer:

```lua
quick.call_and_centre(function()
  print("Yolo!")
end)
quick.cmd_and_centre("SomeCommand")
```
