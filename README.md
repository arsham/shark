## Nvim

I am using a mixture of vimscript and lua for this setup. The aim to have a fast
startup time and provide the functionalities I need for day-to-day tasks.

## Tinyvim

Tinyvim is supposed to be tiny vim setup. I need to find a better name for it,
but for now it serves the purpose.

There is an alias in the `.zaliases` file to isolate the setup from the main
nvim setup.
Almost everything is setup with lua. The aim to have a fast start-up time and
provide the functionalities I need for day-to-day tasks. At the moment it takes
about 20ms to start.
