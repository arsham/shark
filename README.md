# NeoVim setup, fast as a shark

The goal of this project is to have a fast Neovim startup, provide mappings
that can be easily memorised, interact with the **Lua** API, and make
programming fun.

This project supports Neovim version `0.10.0` and newer.

## Highlights

- Besides in a few places that Neovim doesn't provide an API in Lua, most
  configuration is done in **Lua**.
- You can add the current location of the cursor or make **notes** on the
  current location in the **quickfix/local** lists with repeatable mappings.
- You can **manipulate** quickfix/local lists.

## Setup

Just clone this project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/arsham/shark.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Once you start `Neovim`, it will install the package manager and installs the
listed plugins.

## Functionality

### Plugins

This list might change at any time depending on if there is a better
replacement or the requirement changes.

### Core Mappings

In most mappings we are following this theme, unless there is an uncomfortable
situation or messes with a community-driven or Vim's very well known mapping:

| Part of mapping | Description                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **q**           | **Q**uickfix list mappings                        |
| **w**           | **L**ocal list mappings (because it's near **q**) |
| **]**           | Jumps to the next item                            |
| **[**           | Jumps to the previous item                        |
| **b**           | **B**uffer                                        |
| **f**           | **F**ile, **F**ind                                |

The `leader` key is `space`!

### Lists

There are a few tools for interacting with **quickfix** and **local** lists.
Following mappings can be used for either cases, all you need to do it to
substitute `w` for `q` or vice versa. Generally **q** is for **quickfix** list
and **w** is for **local list**. I chose **w** because it's beside **q** and it
makes it easy to think about these two types of lists.

`<leader>qq`, `<leader>ww`, `<leader>qn` and `<leader>wn` are repeatable with
**.**!

After adding an item to the list, an indicator in the **statusline** will show
you how many items you have in a list.

Most actions can apply to multiple selected items if possible.

| Mapping            | Description                                            |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `<Ctrl-p>`         | File list in current folder.                           |
| `<Alt-p>`          | File list in home folder.                              |
| `<Ctrl-b>`         | **B**uffer list.                                       |
| `<Alt-b>`          | Delete **b**uffers from the buffer list.               |
| `<Ctrl-/>`         | Search in lines on current buffer.                     |
| `<Alt-/>`          | Search in lines of **all open buffers**.               |
| `<leader>@`        | Search in **ctags** or **LSP** symbols (see below).    |
| `<leader>:`        | Commands                                               |
| `<leader>ff`       | **F**ind in contents of all files in current folder.   |
| `<leader>fF`       | Like `<leader>ff`, but you can filter filenames too    |
| `<leader>fa`       | **F**ind **A**ll disabling `.gitignore` handling.      |
| `<leader>fA`       | Like `<leader>fA`, but you can filter filenames too    |
| `<leader>fi`       | **I**ncrementally **F**ind.                            |
| `<leader>rg`       | Search (**rg**) with current word.                     |
| `<leader>fG`       | Like `<leader>fG`, but you can filter filenames too    |
| `<leader>ra`       | Search (**rg**) disabling `.gitignore` handling.       |
| `<leader>rA`       | Like `<leader>rA`, but you can filter filenames too    |
| `<leader>ri`       | **I**ncrementally search (**rg**) with current word.   |
| `<leader>fh`       | **F**ile **H**istory                                   |
| `<leader>fl`       | **F**ile **l**ocate (requires mlocate)                 |
| `<leader>gf`       | **GFiles**                                             |
| `<leader>mm`       | **Marks**                                              |
| `<Ctrl-x><Ctrl-k>` | Search in **dictionaries** (requires **words-insane**) |
| `<Ctrl-x><Ctrl-f>` | Search in **f**iles                                    |
| `<Ctrl-x><Ctrl-l>` | Search in **l**ines                                    |

If you keep hitting `<Ctrl-/>` the preview window will change width. With
`Shift-/` you can show and hide the preview window.

When a file is selected, additional to what **fzf** provides out of the box,
you can invoke one of these secondary actions:

| Mapping | Description                        |
| :------ | :--------------------------------- |
| `alt-/` | To search in the lines.            |
| `alt-@` | To search in ctags or lsp symbols. |
| `alt-:` | To go to a specific line.          |
| `alt-q` | Add items to the quickfix list.    |
| `alt-w` | Add items to the local list.       |

Note that if a `LSP` server is not attached to the buffer, it will fall back to
`ctags`.

Sometimes when you list files and `sink` with **@**, the `LSP` might not be
ready yet, therefore it falls back to `ctags` immediately. In this case you can
cancel, which will land you to the file, and you can invoke `<leader>@` for
**LSP** symbols.

There are a few added commands to what fzf provides.

### Utilities

These are commands you can use in **Lua** land. Assign the required module to a
variable and re-use.

```lua
local quick = require("arshlib.quick")
```

#### Normal

Executes a normal command. For example:

```lua
quick.normal("n", "y2k")
```

See `:h feedkeys()` for values of the mode.

#### Highlight

Create `highlight` groups:

```lua
quick.highlight("LspReferenceRead", { ctermbg = 180, guibg = "#43464F", style = "bold" })
```

#### Call and Centre

These functions will call your function/command and then centres the buffer:

```lua
quick.call_and_centre(function()
  print("Yolo!")
end)
quick.cmd_and_centre("SomeCommand")
```
